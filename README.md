# KSH
A *NIX-like shell for Windows & Linux.

**Disclaimer**
The code in this repository is pretty bad.
I barely know rust, so yeah, expect a segfault lmao.

### Building
To build KSH, you need to have the following installed:
* The entire Rust toolchain
* The GNU C Compiler (GCC)

Once you have those installed, you can run `cargo build --release` to build KSH.

#### Code Style
KSH uses the Rustfmt code style. Please run `cargo fmt` before making a pull request.
